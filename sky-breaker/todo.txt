Project Backlog:
	Basic Setup:
		Wall Cling
		Wall Jump
		Have player fall off wall after hanging for too long (5-10 seconds)
		Coyote time
		Input safegaurding (input leniency, mostly needed for jump)
		Create a death area so the player dies if they fall below the screen
		Create a camera to scroll through the level as the player goes higher. Camera doesn't go back down
	Feature Testing:
		Moving platforms
		Wall spikes
		Floor spikes
		Unclingable walls
		Wall slide
		Falling objects
	Polish:
		Switch from base animations to warrior animations
		Jump and gravity tweaks
		Tweak controls
	Ship:
		Create submission
		Submit to game jam page

Next Sprint 1/10:
 Focus: Establish basic controls for the game to function properly.
		I need to spend the next sprint working on properly setting up
		wall detection and controls for interacting with walls
