Project Backlog:
	Basic Setup:
		Wall Cling
		Wall Jump
		Have player fall off wall after hanging for too long (2.5-5 seconds)
		Coyote time
		Input safegaurding (input leniency, mostly needed for jump)
		Create a death area so the player dies if they fall below the screen
		Create a camera to scroll through the level as the player goes higher. Camera doesn't go back down
	Feature Testing:
		Moving platforms
		Wall spikes
		Floor spikes
		Unclingable walls
		Wall slide
		Falling objects
	Polish:
		Switch from base animations to warrior animations
		Jump and gravity tweaks
		Tweak controls
	Ship:
		Create submission
		Submit to game jam page

Previous Sprint 1/10:
 Focus: Establish basic controls for the game to function properly.
		I need to spend the next sprint working on properly setting up
		wall detection and controls for interacting with walls
		
 - Wall cling
 - fall off wall
 - Wall jump
 
 Results: I was able to setup a wall cling, fall, and jump mechanic. This
		  if my first time setitng up wall jump controls, but the controls
		  work at the very least. Because of the complexity of the wall jump
		  code so far, I will need to do some revisions on the code that I 
		  will save for the next sprint.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Sprint 2/10:
 Focus: Refactor controls setup so that we influence the velocity of the 
		player rather than setting it. In addition, let's get rid of wall cling
		and just have a wall jump that will require a specific Input to trigger
		the wall jump code. Taking the wall cling out of the game should make
		the initial setup go much smoother.

 - Coyote Time
 - Input leniency
 - Remove wall cling
